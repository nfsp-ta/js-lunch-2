# JavaScript Lunch &amp; Learn - Part 2

## Agenda
- Introduction ~2 minutes
- 3 Topics ~16 minutes each (~48 minutes total)
- Open Discussion ~10 minutes

## Disclaimers
- We will be moving very quickly, each topic could probably be its own L&L. Feel free to contact Omar or Ashley after the L&L with more questions.
- JavaScript is a spec, and implementations vary (per browser, node, etc...)
- Currently, it's very common for JavaScript to be transpiled (think Babel, TypeScript) or use a bundler like Webpack; for the most part, we're going to ignore this unless it specifically applies to a particular topic.
- For the most part, we'll be presenting code that is as implementation agnostic as possible, but there are always subtle differences.
